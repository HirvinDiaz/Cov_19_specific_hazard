abstract = {Background: Brazil ranks second worldwide in total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Understanding the possible socioeconomic and ethnic health inequities is particularly important given the diverse population and fragile political and economic situation. We aimed to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and assess variations in mortality according to region, ethnicity, comorbidities, and symptoms. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de Vigil{\^{a}}ncia Epidemiol{\'{o}}gica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. In the study, we included hospitalised patients who had a positive RT-PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who had ethnicity information in the dataset. Ethnicity of participants was classified according to the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: Branco (White), Preto (Black), Amarelo (East Asian), Ind{\'{i}}geno (Indigenous), or Pardo (mixed ethnicity). We assessed regional variations in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital by state and by two socioeconomically grouped regions (north and central-south). We used mixed-effects Cox regression survival analysis to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. Findings: Of 99 557 patients in the SIVEP-Gripe dataset, we included 11 321 patients in our study. 9278 (82{\textperiodcentered}0{\%}) of these patients were from the central-south region, and 2043 (18{\textperiodcentered}0{\%}) were from the north region. Compared with White Brazilians, Pardo and Black Brazilians with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1{\textperiodcentered}45, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}33–1{\textperiodcentered}58 for Pardo Brazilians; 1{\textperiodcentered}32, 1{\textperiodcentered}15–1{\textperiodcentered}52 for Black Brazilians). Pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age) for death. Comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospital in the north region than in the central-south, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. States in the north had higher HRs compared with those of the central-south, except for Rio de Janeiro, which had a much higher HR than that of the other central-south states. Interpretation: We found evidence of two distinct but associated effects: increased mortality in the north region (regional effect) and in the Pardo and Black populations (ethnicity effect). We speculate that the regional effect is driven by increasing comorbidity burden in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development. The ethnicity effect might be related to differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to health care (including intensive care) across ethnicities. Our analysis supports an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect Pardo and Black Brazilians, as well as the population of poorer states, from their higher risk of dying of COVID-19.

@article{Charvat2016,
abstract = {The excess hazard regression model is an approach developed for the analysis of cancer registry data to estimate net survival, that is, the survival of cancer patients that would be observed if cancer was the only cause of death. Cancer registry data typically possess a hierarchical structure: individuals from the same geographical unit share common characteristics such as proximity to a large hospital that may influence access to and quality of health care, so that their survival times might be correlated. As a consequence, correct statistical inference regarding the estimation of net survival and the effect of covariates should take this hierarchical structure into account. It becomes particularly important as many studies in cancer epidemiology aim at studying the effect on the excess mortality hazard of variables, such as deprivation indexes, often available only at the ecological level rather than at the individual level. We developed here an approach to fit a flexible excess hazard model including a random effect to describe the unobserved heterogeneity existing between different clusters of individuals, and with the possibility to estimate non-linear and time-dependent effects of covariates. We demonstrated the overall good performance of the proposed approach in a simulation study that assessed the impact on parameter estimates of the number of clusters, their size and their level of unbalance. We then used this multilevel model to describe the effect of a deprivation index defined at the geographical level on the excess mortality hazard of patients diagnosed with cancer of the oral cavity.

@article{Chen2020,
abstract = {Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health emergency. The cumulative number of new confirmed cases and deaths are still increasing out of China. Independent predicted factors associated with fatal outcomes remain uncertain. Research Question: The goal of the current study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes from COVID-19 through a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model. Study Design and Methods: A retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established. The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model. A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19. Results: In this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age ≥ 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95{\%} CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95{\%} CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95{\%} CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin level {\textgreater} 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95{\%} CI, 3.42-22.28), and aspartate aminotransferase level {\textgreater} 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome. A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis. The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95{\%} CI, 0.85-0.97). The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation. Interpretation: The proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics. Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high risk.},

@article{Fauvernier2019,
abstract = {Describing the dynamics of patient mortality hazard is a major concern for cancer epidemiologists. In addition to time and age, other continuous covariates have often to be included in the model. For example, survival trend analyses and socio-economic studies deal respectively with the year of diagnosis and a deprivation index. Taking advantage of a recent theoretical framework for general smooth models, the paper proposes a penalized approach to hazard and excess hazard models in time-to-event analyses. The baseline hazard and the functional forms of the covariates were specified by using penalized natural cubic regression splines with associated quadratic penalties. Interactions between continuous covariates and time-dependent effects were dealt with by forming a tensor product smooth. The smoothing parameters were estimated by optimizing either the Laplace approximate marginal likelihood criterion or the likelihood cross-validation criterion. The regression parameters were estimated by direct maximization of the penalized likelihood of the survival model, which avoids data augmentation and the Poisson likelihood approach. The implementation proposed was evaluated on simulations and applied to real data. It was found to be numerically stable, efficient and useful for choosing the appropriate degree of complexity in overall survival and net survival contexts; moreover, it simplified the model building process.},

@article{Petrilli2020,
abstract = {AbstractObjective To describe outcomes of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United States, and the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with severity of illness. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Single academic medical center in New York City and Long Island. Participants 5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020. Main outcome measures Outcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death. Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality. Results Of 11 544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2{\%}) were positive. After exclusions, 5279 were included. 2741 of these 5279 (51.9{\%}) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5{\%}) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3{\%}) were discharged to hospice care or died. Of 647 (23.6{\%}) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4{\%}) died and 170 (26.2{\%}) were extubated or discharged. The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of {\textgreater}2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95{\%} confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older. Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI {\textgreater}40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI {\textgreater}40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen saturation of {\textless}88{\%} (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level {\textgreater}1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level {\textgreater}200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level {\textgreater}2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period. Similar associations were found for mortality alone. Conclusions Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality. Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care.},
